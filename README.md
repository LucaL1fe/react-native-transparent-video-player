**Transparent (alpha-channel) video for React Native — as a plain H.264 MP4 that plays on every iOS and Android hardware decoder.**

No codec-alpha support needed, no giant animated WebP/GIF files, no per-frame CPU decoding. A ~70-line Skia component plays an "alpha-packed" MP4 and recombines color + alpha on the GPU.

## Quick start

**1. Pack your video** — any video with an alpha channel (e.g. ProRes 4444), any resolution (ffmpeg required, see below):

```bash
npx pack-alpha-video hero-4444.mov
# → hero-packed.mp4
```

**2. Install:**

```bash
npx expo install react-native-transparent-video-skia @shopify/react-native-skia react-native-reanimated
```

**3. Play it:**

```tsx
import { TransparentVideo } from 'react-native-transparent-video-skia';

<TransparentVideo
  source={require('./assets/hero-packed.mp4')}
  width={300}
  height={300}
/>
```

That's it — the video renders with real transparency over whatever is behind it.

> **Export tip:** deliver **ProRes 4444 with the alpha channel enabled** from your editor or motion tool, at display resolution (e.g. 900×900), 24–30 fps. Every professional tool can do this.

## The `pack-alpha-video` CLI

```bash
npx pack-alpha-video <input-with-alpha> [more inputs ...] [options]
```

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--fps <n>` | `24` | Output frame rate. 24 looks perfectly smooth for animations; 30+ only adds file size. |
| `--scale <percent>` | `100` | Resize to a percentage of the source size (e.g. `--scale 50` halves width and height). |
| `--quality <0-100>` | `75` | Output quality in percent. 75 ≈ visually lossless; lower = smaller file. |
| `-o, --out-dir <dir>` | cwd | Where to write `<name>-packed.mp4`. |
| `--width <px>` | — | Alternative to `--scale`: resize to an exact pixel width (keeps aspect ratio). |
| `--size <WxH>` | — | Force an exact output frame (e.g. `--size 900x900`) from **any** aspect ratio: content is scaled to fit and the remainder is padded with **transparent** pixels — never stretched. |
| `--crf <n>` | — | Advanced: raw x264 CRF value, overrides `--quality`. |

**Supported inputs** — any video with a real alpha channel, at any resolution (odd dimensions are handled automatically):

- **ProRes 4444** `.mov` with alpha channel (recommended — every editor/motion tool exports this)
- **VP9 / VP8** `.webm` with alpha
- `.mov`/`.mkv`/`.avi` with an alpha-capable codec: **PNG, QuickTime Animation (QTRLE), FFV1, Ut Video**
- Files *without* alpha (plain H.264/HEVC exports) are rejected with a clear message — note that HEVC-with-alpha is not supported; use ProRes 4444 or VP9 WebM instead.

**Requirements:** Node.js and ffmpeg in your PATH — works on **Windows, macOS and Linux**
(macOS: `brew install ffmpeg` · Windows: `winget install ffmpeg` · Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`).

## Why this beats GIF and animated WebP

Real measurement — the same 900×900 transparent character animation, exported three ways:

| Format | Size |
|---|---|
| Animated WebP | **11 MB** |
| AVIF | **5.2 MB** |
| **Alpha-packed MP4 (this)** | **1.1 MB** ✅ |

Category by category:

| | Alpha-packed MP4 + Skia | GIF | Animated WebP | APNG | Lottie | HEVC/VP9 codec-alpha |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **File size** | ✅ Inter-frame H.264 compression (10× smaller than WebP above) | ❌ Huge | ❌ Mostly per-frame, large | ❌ Largest | ✅ Tiny — but vector-only | ✅ Small |
| **Color + alpha** | ✅ 24-bit color, 8-bit alpha | ❌ 256 colors, 1-bit alpha | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Decode cost / battery** | ✅ Hardware video decoder + GPU shader | ❌ CPU | ❌ CPU, expensive at large sizes | ❌ CPU | ⚠ CPU (JS/native render) | ✅ Hardware (when supported) |
| **Memory** | ✅ Streams frames | ❌ Frame caches | ❌ Frame caches | ❌ Frame caches | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Device compatibility** | ✅ Plain H.264 — every iOS/Android hardware decoder ever shipped | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Codec/vendor-dependent (HEVC-alpha ≈ Apple-only, VP9-alpha ≈ no iOS hardware) |
| **Rendered from real footage / 3D / hand animation** | ✅ Any video source | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Vector animations only | ✅ |
| **Playback control** | ✅ `paused` accepts a Reanimated `SharedValue` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Honest trade-offs:** you add `@shopify/react-native-skia` + `react-native-reanimated` as dependencies, your asset needs a one-time packing step, and it's not a drop-in `<Image>` replacement.

## How it works

**Platform split (v0.3.0+):** iOS renders through Skia (a RuntimeEffect shader on the GPU). **Android uses a native ExoPlayer + OpenGL view** — Skia's video decoding is bypassed entirely there, because its GPU frame import only understands RGBA buffers while Android hardware decoders emit vendor YUV formats (frames render black on many devices, e.g. recent Samsung flagships). The native view uses the same decoder→`SurfaceTexture`→`samplerExternalOES` pipeline every Android video player relies on, so it works on every device and GPU. No `minSdkVersion` override is needed (module minSdk 24).

Android consumers need `expo-modules-core` — already present in every Expo app; bare React Native apps can add it with `npx install-expo-modules`.

The packed MP4 is a completely normal H.264 video, **twice as tall** as your animation:

```
┌──────────────┐
│  color (RGB) │  ← premultiplied color, top half
├──────────────┤
│  alpha matte │  ← alpha channel as grayscale, bottom half
└──────────────┘
```

At render time a Skia runtime shader samples the color from the top half and the alpha from the bottom half of the same frame and recombines them on the GPU:

```glsl
half4 main(float2 xy) {
  half3 rgb = video.eval(xy).rgb;
  half  a   = video.eval(float2(xy.x, xy.y + halfH)).r;
  return half4(rgb, a);
}
```

Because the transport is plain `yuv420p` H.264, the OS hardware decoder does all the heavy lifting — transparency support is never the codec's problem. The color is premultiplied by alpha during packing so bilinear sampling never produces dark edge fringes.

## API

### `<TransparentVideo />`

| Prop | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | `number \| string` | `require(...)` of a packed MP4, or a URI string. Asset modules resolve via `expo-asset` when installed, otherwise via `Image.resolveAssetSource` (bare RN). |
| `width` | `number` | Display width. |
| `height` | `number` | Display height (= half the packed video's pixel height). |
| `loop` | `boolean` | Loop playback (default `true`). Set `false` for one-shot animations. |
| `paused` | `boolean \| SharedValue<boolean>` | Pause playback; accepts a Reanimated shared value for UI-thread control. |
| `onEnd` | `() => void` | Fires when a non-looping video finishes. Currently Android-only (native player event). |
| `style` | `StyleProp<ViewStyle>` | Extra styles for the view. |
